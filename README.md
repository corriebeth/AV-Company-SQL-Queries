This project analyzes operational performance and profitability for an audiovisual (AV) company using SQL. The dataset contains records of rental events, including costs, event types, locations, equipment rented, and client satisfaction scores. The analysis focuses on uncovering insights into profitability, cost structure, equipment efficiency, and customer satisfaction. 

Key Objectives & Insights

1. Profitability by Event Type
Identified the most and least profitable event categories by calculating total revenue (rental cost minus labor and transport costs) across all event types.

2. Cost Structure Breakdown
Analyzed total labor and transportation expenses by event type to determine which services contribute most to operational costs.

3. City-Level Profit Margins
Calculated average profit margins per city to reveal which locations yield the highest returns on rentals.

4. Equipment Utilization Efficiency
Measured utilization rates across equipment categories by comparing hours rented to total hours on site — highlighting underused or overbooked assets.

5. Event Duration and Profitability Relationship
Compared total revenue for short-, mid-, and long-duration events to assess how event length impacts profitability.

6. High-Cost, Low-Profit Events
Evaluated event types with high expenses relative to revenue to identify opportunities for cost optimization or pricing adjustments.

7. Revenue vs. Client Satisfaction
Explored how profitability correlates with client satisfaction levels to assess whether higher profits align with better customer experiences.

8. Satisfaction by Event Type and City
Calculated average client satisfaction by both event type and city to highlight performance strengths and improvement areas.
